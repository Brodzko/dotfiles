# Personal Preferences

<!-- Add your personal coding preferences, conventions, and guidance here -->

## Communication Style

- Be concise and direct
- Skip unnecessary explanations
- Never lie or mislead - if uncertain, explicitly ask for assistance
- Be concise enough to read quickly, but don't omit necessary information

## Code Style (TypeScript/React)

- Never use comments disabling type or lint rules - if they complain, fix the implementation
- No `any`, `unknown`, or type casts unless absolutely necessary (explain why if used)
- Use Remeda for utility functions, prefer pipes and functional helpers: `import * as R from 'remeda'`
- React components: arrow functions, add `{ComponentName}.displayName = 'ComponentName'` at bottom, use named exports
- No default exports unless absolutely necessary (explain why if used)
- Prefer arrow functions unless special type overrides are needed

## Common Commands

<!-- Add frequently used commands for your projects:
- Build: `pnpm build`
